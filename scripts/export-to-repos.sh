# Exports front-end/, back-end/, and deployment/ from this repo (the
# canonical CDIS Template) out to the three independent sibling repos —
# cdis-frontend, cdis-backend, cdis-deployment.
#
# This is one-directional and deliberate: all real work happens here,
# in the monorepo, first. The three sibling repos are never edited
# directly — they're regenerated from this one, so there is exactly
# one place any given line of code can drift from.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/export-to-repos.sh
# Requires the three sibling repos to already exist as directories
# next to this one (../cdis-frontend, ../cdis-backend, ../cdis-deployment),
# each a real git clone of the matching GitHub repo.
#
# This script only updates each sibling's working tree — it never
# commits or pushes. Review `git status`/`git diff` in each sibling
# and commit/push by hand once you're happy with the result.

# sibling repo, not generated here. Without this exclude, `rsync
# --delete` would wipe out each sibling's .github/workflows/ on every
# export, since the monorepo's front-end/back-end/deployment folders
# don't have one to copy from.
